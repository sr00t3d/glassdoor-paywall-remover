# Glassdoor Paywall Remover (Update)

This userscript removes annoying overlays and inline style restrictions on Glassdoor pages, allowing users to scroll and read content freely â€” even when a paywall or "ContentWall" is present.

> âœ… Works on Glassdoor pages with `.main` layout block and paywall overlays.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Hides paywall elements like:
  - `#HardsellOverlay`
  - `#ContentWallHardsell`
  - `#UserAlert`
- Unlocks scrolling on blocked pages.
- Removes inline styles that force fixed height/position.
- Observes and auto-corrects dynamic reapplication of styles using `MutationObserver`.

## ðŸ›  How it works

The script waits for the page to fully load, then:

1. Removes known paywall overlays.
2. Unlocks page scroll by removing inline CSS on `<body class="main">`.
3. Injects custom CSS to ensure scroll is restored on `<main>`.
4. Watches for any reapplication of the restrictive styles and removes them in real time.
